Left Drawer Menu
------------------

This is a one-page template for a mobile site that needs a left drawer slide out menu. I find myself needing these kinds of things when prototyping. The jQuery code contains a couple variables you can change if you want to adjust width of the drawer as well as its opening/closing speed.
